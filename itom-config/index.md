# IT Operations Management (ITOM) 
Hornbill's IT Operations Management (ITOM) includes administrative processes and support for software and hardware that allow you to execute routine tasks to support and control your IT services and IT infrastructure. ITOM is based around several key components hosted within the Hornbill cloud and an on-premise service running behind the corporate firewall. These components provide the ability to discover devices across the network infrastructure, use various techniques, and initiate IT automation and orchestrations.

Packages are the core components used to provide IT automations and are the building blocks used within an orchestration built using runbooks. They are published within the ITOM Package Library, produced and maintained by Hornbill, with new packages being added regularly. You can also create custom packages as required, with expertise available in-house using the ITOM Package creator.

You can create individual automations directly within the Job queue or scheduled along with runbooks using the Job Scheduler and easily accessed via other Hornbill applications with access to the Business Process Engine or AutoTasks. Developers can use Hornbill's XMLMC API to trigger an automation or runbook process, allowing external applications and systems to be integrated.

To grant users access to ITOM, assuming you have a subscription or are using the free tier, you assign rights to the various features provided.

## ITOM subscription tiers
Free preview access is available by default for all Hornbill subscriptions. The free tier enables you to give ITOM a try and navigate its full capabilities. The free tier is limited to 10 job runs per month; if your usage in production is so light that 10 jobs are enough, you may use ITOM in production without a subscription.

ITOM is available in different subscription tiers. All instances have access to the basic free tier, and you can upgrade by request. The functionality available on each tier is as follows:
