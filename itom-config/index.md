# IT Operations Managment (ITOM) 
Hornbill's IT Operations Management (ITOM) includes administrative processes and support for software and hardware that allow you to execute routine tasks to support and control your IT services and IT infrastructure. Based around several key components hosted within the Hornbill cloud and an on-premise service running behind the corporate firewall. These components allow the ability to discover devices across the network infrastructure, use various techniques, and initiate IT automation and Orchestrations.

Packages are the core components used to provide IT Automations and are the building blocks used within an Orchestration built using Runbooks. They are published within the ITOM Package Library, produced and maintained by Hornbill, with packages being regularly developed. It is also possible the creation of custom packages where required, and the expertise is available in-house using the ITOM Package creator.

Individual Automations can be created directly within the Job queue or scheduled along with Runbooks using the Job Scheduler and easily accessed via other Hornbill applications with access to the Business Process Engine or AutoTasks. Developers can use Hornbill's XMLMC API to trigger an Automation or Runbook process, allowing external applications and systems to be integrated.

To gain access to ITOM, assuming you have a subscription or are using the free tier, users will need to be assigned rights to the various features provided.

## ITOM Subscription
Free preview access is available by default for all Hornbill subscriptions when you have no ITOM subscription. The free tier is provided to enable you to give ITOM a try and let you navigate around the full capabilities of ITOM. The free tier is limited to 10 job runs a month to facilitate this trial; if your usage in production is so light that ten jobs are enough, you are free to use ITOM capabilities in production without a subscription.
