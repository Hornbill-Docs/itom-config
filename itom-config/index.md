# IT Operations Management (ITOM) 
ITOM is Hornbill's solution for on-premises IT automation. With ITOM, you can manage your organization’s IT services and infrastructure by automating the routine tasks and processes that consume the bulk of your IT staff’s time and energy.

Hornbill’s IT automation is based on key components hosted within the Hornbill cloud, and a service running behind your corporate firewall. These components enable you to discover devices across your network infrastructure, manage device inventory, and initiate IT automations and orchestrations.

**Site Integration Service.** The SIS behind your firewall discovers desktops, laptops, servers, and other IT assets.

**Packages and runbooks.** Packages provide IT automations and are the building blocks of orchestrations built with runbooks. Packages, published within the ITOM Package Library, are produced and maintained by Hornbill. New packages are being added regularly. You can also create custom packages as required using ITOM’s Package Creator.

**Job queue and the Job Scheduler.** You can execute individual automations directly within the job queue or schedule them along with runbooks using the Job Scheduler. Your automations are easily accessed via other Hornbill applications with access to the Business Process Workflow Engine or AutoTasks.

**Integrations.** For integration of external applications and systems, developers can use Hornbill’s XMLMC API to trigger an automation or runbook process.

**Access.** To grant users access to ITOM, you assign rights to the various features provided.

## ITOM subscription tiers
ITOM is available in subscription tiers. Free preview access is available by default for all Hornbill subscriptions. The Free Preview tier enables you to try out ITOM and navigate its full capabilities. The free tier is limited to 10 job runs per month; if your usage in production is so light that 10 jobs are enough, you may use ITOM in production without a subscription. You may upgrade to a higher tier by request.

The functionality available on each tier is as follows:
