# Roles
ITOM roles are collections of rights that provide access to different features and functionality within ITOM. System roles are provided with preset rights that are required for users to perform common job roles.  User defined roles can also be created.

## Topics Covered
* The roles that are included with ITOM at installation.

## Before you Begin
* Have an understanding of how [roles are managed](/esp-config/organizational-data/roles)
::: tip
 Assigning a role with a privilege level of `user` or higher to a user can automatically allocate a Service Manager subscription license to that user.
