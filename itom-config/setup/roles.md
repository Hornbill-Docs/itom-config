# Roles
ITOM roles are collections of rights that provide access to features and functionality within ITOM. System roles are provided with preset rights that are required for users to perform common job roles. You can also create custom roles.

The [ITOM Application Administrator role](/itom-config/setup/roles#itom-application-administrator) has rights to administer the application, manage application settings, and manage Site Integration Services.

The [ITOM Application User role](/itom-config/setup/roles#itom-application-administrator) has rights to use the application; manage, create, update, and delete Scheduled Jobs; and manage Workflows, Autotasks, Lifecycle Processes, Progressive Capture, KeySafe, Site Integration Services, Runbooks, Automation Jobs, and Inventory.

## Before you begin
Understand how [roles are managed](/esp-config/organizational-data/roles).
::: note
 When you assign a role with a privilege level of `user` or higher, a Service Manager subscription license is automatically allocated to that user.
