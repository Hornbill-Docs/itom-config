# Translations
Translations in Hornbill ITOM provide the ability to translate individual strings of text into the language of your choice. While many of these strings can be translated through the user interface using [Translation Mode](/esp-config/internationalization/translation-mode), this is not always the case and some strings must be translated here.

::: note
All the translation strings available here are related to the ITOM application only. Each Hornbill application has its own area for providing translations as well as [the platform](/esp-config/internationalization/user-interface-translations), [Customer Portal](/esp-config/customize/customer-portal/configure-customer-portal#translations), and [Employee Portal](/esp-config/customize/employee-portal/employee-portal-configuration#translations).
